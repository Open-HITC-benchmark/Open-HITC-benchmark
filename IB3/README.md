# Soret effect

Based on the applied test case simulated with Xolotl in https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-4326/abd95f

## Summary
1D case in a W slab, including Fickian and Soret diffusion fluxes for D, T and He: temporal content and concentration profiles at the steady state.
Case without Soret and with Soret are compared
